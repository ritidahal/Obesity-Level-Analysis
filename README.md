# Obesity Level Analysis

## Project Objective
To explore and analyze behavioral, demographic, and lifestyle-related factors influencing obesity using a dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The goal is to generate insights that may assist healthcare professionals and policymakers.

## Dataset Description
Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository
Rows: 2,111 observations
Features: 17 variables (e.g., age, gender, height, weight, physical activity, food intake, screen time)
Target Variable: NObeyesdad â€“ categorical variable representing different obesity levels

## Key Analysis Steps
### Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

- Checked for and removed outliers

- Converted string labels into numerical categories where needed

- Validated data types and ranges

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Descriptive statistics

- Histograms, boxplots, and scatterplots to explore distributions and relationships

- Correlation analysis for numerical features

### Findings

- Strong links between obesity and high calorie consumption, lack of physical activity, and family history

- High screen time (TUE) correlated with obesity

- Gender and age patterns are visible in the obesity distribution

### Business Relevance

- Supports dieticians and healthcare practitioners in identifying at-risk individuals early

- Aids in developing targeted intervention strategies based on behavioral traits

- Highlights the importance of lifestyle changes in preventing obesity

### Tools & Technologies
- Python (Spyder IDE)

- Libraries: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn

- Data Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository

### Summary of Results
- Most obese individuals consumed fewer vegetables and more calories regularly

- Low physical activity (FAF) and long hours using technology (TUE) are key indicators

- Family history plays a significant role in predicting obesity
